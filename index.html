        <h1>Permanent Temporary</h1>
        <p>
            Temporal is aiming for permanence
            But much benevolence paints the prudence
            To keep change changing 
            To keep range ranging 
            To give meaning to purpose and hope
            To create a future into which to elope 
            From an old past on stone cast
            Onwards fast to a great that will last
        </p> 
        <p>
            Even that which may last forever 
            In light of memory that may favour whatever 
            Will suffer oblivion 
            And the wavering of opinion 
            Until it is craved for and recalled 
            Once again hailed and installed 
            Only to be trampled underfoot again 
            And such be the recurring strain
        </p>
        <p>
            So affirms the permanence of temporaries
            Times and heirs being the emissaries 
            Passing down through the years 
            All cheers and jeers across seers and peers
            And so it is now as it was then
            Such temptations common to men
            Throughout time and space
            Even as enduring wisdom is strained of grace
        </p>
